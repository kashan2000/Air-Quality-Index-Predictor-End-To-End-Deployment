# Air Quality Index Predictor with Deployment
## A web application which will predict the Air Quality Index of a place.
### In this project I have already provided the input Data in the app.py file.
It is advisable to make some changes to that file and let the user input the data.
### In this project we will be building an Air Quality Index Predictor with the help of Machine Learning Models and Auto ML library i.e. TPOTÂ¶
### In this project we are having a data set of Bangalore city which have the Air Quality Index information from the year 2013-2018.
